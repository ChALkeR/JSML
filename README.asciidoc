JSML

What is JSML?
-------------
JSML is a compact representation of HTML using Javascript arrays and
objects.  JSML is also a small jQuery plug-in that allows you to construct
DOM elements from these structured Javascript objects. Here's a quick
example:

  $("#my-element").jsml(["a", { href: "http://example.com" }, "This is a <link>" ])

That finds the div identified by "my-element" and replaces its contents with:

  <a href="http://example.com">This is a &lt;link&gt;</a>

...except that there's never an actual HTML string created. JSML uses
'document.createElement()', 'document.createTextNode()' and
'document.appendChild()' to build up the DOM representation directly which
means that you never have to worry about quoting HTML entities which helps
prevent XSS
(https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cross_site_scripting[cross
site scripting]) attacks by being secure by default.

Here's a slightly more complicated example:

  $("#my-element").jsml(["ul",
                         ["li", { style: { backgroundColor: "red" } }, "First item"],
                         ["li",
                          ["img", { src: "myimage.png", title: "A title"},
                                  { alt: "Some Alt-text" }], "Second item"],
                         $("<li>raw html item</li>")])

Additional things to notice:

  * The basic idea is that new arrays signal new elements. The first item in
    an array defines what type of element. The rest of the items in an array
    are either attributes or child elements.

  * Objects (enclosed in "'{}'") let you define an element's attributes. You
    can have multiple objects in the array--they simply accumulate. If you
    have duplicate keys in the objects then the last one in the array wins.

  * As a special case you can drill down into the style with a nested object
    (though it's not necessarily the best thing to do).

  * Style and attribute names are the standard Javascript equivalents
    ("border-top" is "borderTop", "class" is "className").

  * You can use jQuery to drop in unquoted HTML strings if you absolutely
    need to.

Advanced Usage
--------------
JSML has special support for 'map' functions (Underscore's is shown here):

  $("#my-element").jsml(["ul", _.map([1,2,3], function(num) { return ["li", "Item "+num] })]);

If you're paying attention you'll notice that the structure passed to the
'jsml()' function looks like this:

  ["ul", [["li", "Item 1"],
          ["li", "Item 2"],
          ["li", "Item 3"]]]

...which has extra array around the list items unlike the standard
syntax:

  ["ul", ["li", "Item 1"],
         ["li", "Item 2"],
         ["li", "Item 3"]]

JSML automatically flattens this extra level of arrays to make using 'map()'
convenient. This is also useful for passing in an array of uniform items in
a JSML structure (which means there's usually no need to use 'concat()').

  var a = [];
  a.push(["li", "Item 1"],
         ["li", "Item 2"]);
  $("#my-element").jsml(["ul", a]);

You can also pass DOM element objects and jQuery objects and those will
be appended:

  var li = document.createElement("li");
  li.appendChild(document.createTextNode("Standard DOM element"));
  $("#my-element").jsml(["ul", li, $("<li>jQuery element</li>")]);

If you wish to create detached DOM elements you can call either
'$.fn.jsml.make()' which returns a jQuery wrapped object, or,
'$.fn.jsml.dom()' which returns a standard DOM element object.

How Should I Pronounce This?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are 3 ways to pronounce it, depending on what you think of the
project. If you think it's cool you can call it "Jay-Smile", since its
compact representation and XSS resistance makes you happy. If you are
neutral, you can just call it "Jay Ess Emm Ell". If you hate it, feel free
to call it "Jay-Smell" (and make sure to really sneer when you say it).
